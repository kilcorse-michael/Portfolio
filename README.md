Portfolio page -- Michael A. Kilcorse

This portfolio page is for the completion of the Unit 6 project for Team Treehouse as well as for
my own personal use in searching for employment in the field of web development.

I am going for an Exceeds Expectations grade and as such I have altered the original css files to incorporate
a different color scheme for the backgrounds and text, as well as text shadowing behind titles, and transitions
between pages.

Once all dependencies are downloaded it can be started in the terminal with "npm start"

There were two additional templates created, one that is for displaying errors "error.pug", and one
that serves as an additional layout for the error page "layoutError.pug"

My additional resources were pulled from
